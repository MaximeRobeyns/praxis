Some silly games to keep you sharp...

## Requesting New Games
If you would like to see a new game, please create an 'issue' on github describing this game, or send me an email as maximerobeyns@gmail.com .

## Contributing or reporting a bug
All contributions are very welcome! The theme of this site is simplicity, and it comes as no surprise that the code is simple to match. I have not used any framworks like React.js, jQuery or any server code since the idea is for the site to remain static. If you would like to create a game, please create a branch and try to stay in keeping with this simple approach.

[Here is the game](https://praxis-games.github.io/praxis/)
